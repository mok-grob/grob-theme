# grob-theme
custom micro.blog theme that implements a "demonstrative process" changelog-like aesthetic. 

## concept
reverse mullet: party up front and business in the back. embodies work-as-content ethos. blog home is the workshop; the outputs and projects are afterthoughts. structurally, this means the home feed is composed of the many contributions to the many projects in progress; the projects and their related outputs are static pages.
- the process itself is the content
- the feed is the primary content (the workshop)
- static projects organize the work sessions
- finished pieces are secondary (the outputs)

the aesthetic is deliberately simple, functional, and text-oriented - honoring the original vision of the web as a structured document system while incorporating modern sensibilities.
